TextCap_Protocol

TextCap Protocol is the name of my project, and it simply describes the communication between the server and client in this project. Here the client connects with the server, sends a message to the server, and receives that same message only in an uppercase format hence the name TextCap Protocol. 

## Here are some applications of the TextCap Protocol:
* Messaging Apps: Automatically convert text to uppercase for uniformity or emphasis in group chats or notifications.
* Data Processing Pipelines: Normalize text data to a consistent format for downstream systems, especially in natural language processing tasks.
* Voice Assistants: Standardize user inputs by converting speech-to-text output into a uniform format.
* Real-time Communication: Enhance real-time communication platforms by applying text transformations for clarity or emphasis during messaging.
* Content Moderation: Convert user-generated content into a standard format for easier content analysis and moderation.
